# dynamic-lexicon

This repository provided a home for orphaned data previously found on 
http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/lexicon/ (also static.perseus.tufts.edu/lexicon/)

Note that active management of this phase of the project ceased in 2011.

**General Information**   
The Dynamic Lexicon is an NEH-funded project to automatically create bilingual dictionaries (Greek/English and Latin/English) using parallel texts - source texts in Greek or Latin aligned with their English translations - along with the syntactic data encoded in treebanks. From these raw materials, we can construct a lexical entry that illustrates how a word is used not simply in all of Greek or Latin literature, but in any subset of that collection (e.g., Greek drama or the works of Cicero).

**Data**
The published form of the Dynamic Lexicon includes automatically generated lexical entries along with the underlying intermediate analysis used to generate them (including word-level alignments between source texts and their translations, and automatic morphological tagging and syntactic analysis for the Greek and Latin originals). All data is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike license.
